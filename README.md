# CodeMR Spring Framework Analysis Project
Spring Framework is the foundation for all [Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects). Collectively the Spring Framework and the family of Spring projects is often referred to simply as "Spring".
Spring provides everything required beyond the Java programming language for creating enterprise applications for a wide range of scenarios and architectures. Please read the [Overview](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#spring-introduction) section as reference for a more complete introduction.

## Spring Framework README

Please see [Spring Framework README](README-Spring-Framework.md) in the root directory of the project.
